slicedHEDParallel.R is a one-shot algorithm for generating Sliced representative points based on Hybrid energy distance criterion

SeqslicedHEDParallel.R is a sequential algorithm for generating Sliced representative points based on Hybrid energy distance criterion

Gibbssamplingformixtureswithlinearconstraints. R is a Gibbs sampler for generating uniform random sample in mixture experimental region with linear constraints

InverseTransformMethod.R can transform sample from U([0,1]^{p-1}) to U(T_p(a,b)), where T_p(a,b) mixture experimental region with lower bound a and upper bound b.

sliceddesignformixturesbasedonRSPD.R can generate sliced mixutre design based on the densest packed grid point set (only for T_p(0,1))

example.R is a toy example for these functions, where we generate sliced mixture designs with 4 slices and n_1=n_2=n_3=n_4=10.
